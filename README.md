# Thesis
This repo is for organizing the files and tasks related to my thesis. 

The workflow should follow the guidlines from https://github.com/Severson-Group/severson_group_git. I am also trying to use github issues in the same way as they do in their group. I do most of the git things in terminal, but use VS Code to settle merge conflicts.

This repository uses a package called devenv to make a unique software enviorment just for this repo. I folowed the instructions in https://github.com/adam-gaia/smellgoodcode in smellgoodcode/src/intro.md under devenv.
